Drastic changes to lifestyle often don’t last. Small changes are morelikely to last. I changed my lifestyle last year to include diet andexcercise in my day. I built this app  include the small habits Icontinue to practice to lead a healthy lifestyle.When I first started to learn about being healthy, a lot of the advicehad large lifestyle changes. The options were black and white,and no acknowledgement for even small, positive changes werecited. Eating fruits and vegatables every day is wonderful, yes,but so is replacing 1 of your soda’s a day with water.Acknowleding to people that even small changes in their diet areamazing goals to achieve is a more prudent way to ensure thechanges last a lifetime, and a more pragmattic approach sincewe all have busy lives and can’t just drop everything to start cows.
